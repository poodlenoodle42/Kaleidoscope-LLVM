# Kaleidoscope LLVM
This project is the result of me following the Kaleidoscope LLVM tutorial. 
To spice things up from just copying code from the tutorial I decided to structure the project properly and build it using cmake. 
Furthermore I used the oppertunity to become comfortable with flex and bison. 
I build up the compiler as a somewhat usable program including command line argument parsing and error reporting/recovery. 

## Build
The project was build using LLVM 14. It might work with older/newer versions.
